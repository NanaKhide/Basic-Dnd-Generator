# Basic-Dnd-Generator
This repo is the vary bare minimum of a python "random" generator i create for the DND community. 
I commented every line of code so you can easily modify it and build up on it. A more advanced version will follow...
Also check out the Wiki if you need further explanation.

Requires python 3.10.11 or above (I guess?)
